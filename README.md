# Signature Tabletop RPG system (French)

A homebrew tabletop roleplaying game system I've been using with various groups, both for fun and professionally. It has been tested in various settings and evolved a lot through play, as the many versions will show.

Initially I was looking to make a more streamlined version of the Cypher System for the Numenera setting, but it very soon grew into its own thing, hijacking successful mechanics of other systems such as Savage Worlds or Tiny Dungeons, or completely new gameplay.

The goal is to move to a generic approach where one resolution mechanic joins forces with a narrative influence resource to support contexts provided by the Game Master and players, moving away from simulation or wargaming pre-written content, and closer to a context support system for improv and collaborative storytelling.

That's a mouthful but it boils down to a single type of dice roll and tokens being passed around to influence outcomes.
